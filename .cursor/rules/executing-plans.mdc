# Executing Plans

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan

1. Read plan file from `docs/plans/`
2. Review critically - identify questions or concerns
3. If concerns: Raise them before starting
4. If no concerns: Proceed

### Step 2: Execute Batch (first 3 tasks)

For each task:
1. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
2. Run verifications as specified
3. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Report

When batch complete:
- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback."

### Step 4: Continue

Based on feedback:
- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

### Step 5: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Run full verification: `cargo test --all && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check`
- Present completion options (merge, PR, keep branch, discard)

## Rules

- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Between batches: report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main branch without explicit consent
