# Requesting Code Review

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**
- After completing major feature
- Before merge to main
- After fixing complex bug

**Optional but valuable:**
- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring

## How to Request

1. Get git SHAs:
```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

2. Summarize what was implemented
3. Reference the plan or requirements
4. Run the review

## Act on Feedback

- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with reasoning)

## Red Flags

- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback
