# Verification Before Completion

**This skill is AUTOMATIC** - Apply before claiming ANY work is complete.

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim
```

## Verification Commands for This Project

```bash
cargo test --all                   # All tests pass
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings  # No lint warnings
cargo fmt --check                  # Format correct
cargo build --release              # Release build succeeds
```

## Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | `cargo test --all` output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | `cargo clippy` output: 0 warnings | Partial check |
| Build succeeds | `cargo build`: exit 0 | Clippy passing |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |

## Red Flags - STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Relying on partial verification
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

## The Bottom Line

Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.

This is non-negotiable.
