# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

**This skill is AUTOMATIC** - Apply it before ANY creative work.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible
- Only one question per message
- Focus on: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Present in sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing

## After the Design

- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Commit the design document to git

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each
